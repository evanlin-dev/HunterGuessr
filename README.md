# HunterGuessr

//Project by Evan Lin, Ildefonso Marrero, Midyan Elghazali, Nicholas Grzyb, Shankar Ale Magar
/* HunterGuessr is fan project based off of GeoGuessr
using CUNY-Hunter College as the main point of the game instead of the
globe and its major countries. The intended player base is
mostly incoming freshman or transfer students to get accustomed to
the building prior to going in person. The application/game
is also intended for current students who aren't new as there is
a score system with a leaderboard to determine who is the best
accustomed to Hunter!*\
